### Hello, World! My name is Austin ğŸ‘‹



My journey into analytics started with coding a Smart Mirror with a gen one Raspberry Pi using the Magic Mirror repository. Because of my passion with numbers and coding, I now surround myself with data!


âšª ğŸ¥³ Fun facts: You can find me at an art museum/gellery, I'm a musician (drummer), and I enjoy astronomy!
